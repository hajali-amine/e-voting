# e-voting

The goal of this mini project is to implement an e-voting platform using _truffle_ and _ganache_ to emulate the Etherium blockchain.

## To do

- [x] Prepare the environment using docker containers
- [x] Create the project directory using truffle
- [ ] Create the smart contract that will allow you to read/write in the blockchain
- [ ] Deploy the contract
- [ ] Simulate interaction with the contract

> This is still a work in progress 🙏
